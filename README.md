# Inspiration
My parents are immigrants and they learned English as a second language. Oftentimes when watching Harry Potter, they would come across a strange British word and wonder "what the heck does this mean?!?!?!"

# What it does
It translates between two dialects of English: UK and US

# How we built it
We used file streaming to create dictionaries for UK -> US and US -> UK.

# Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into were creating and accessing the dictionaries we created for the translation

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating our first side-project in a language we have been learning for a month and a half. We are both first years in university, and we both had a great experience participating in our first hackathon ever!

# What we learned
We learned how to use dictionaries to concatenate text together. We also learned a bunch of new British words!!!

# What's next for English Dialect Translator
Next for the English Dialect Translator would be adding more terms which are different between the dialects and adding more dialect options like Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, Irish, Scottish and more.
